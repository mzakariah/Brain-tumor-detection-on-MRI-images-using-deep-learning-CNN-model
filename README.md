This study presents a deep learning model for brain tumor segmentation using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the Barts dataset

The model architecture is based on a fully convolutional network and uses 2D convolutional layers, max pooling, and upsampling to extract features and produce a segmentation mask. The model was trained with a kernel initializer of 'he_normal' and a dropout rate of 0.2. The model achieved an accuracy of 98%, demonstrating its effectiveness in brain tumor segmentation.

In conclusion, we have successfully implemented a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for brain tumor segmentation using the "BARTS" dataset. The model is based on a U-Net architecture, which is a well-known architecture for image segmentation problems. The U-Net architecture consists of a series of convolutional and max-pooling layers, followed by up-sampling layers and concatenation operations, which allow the model to learn both low- and high-level features from the input images.

The model achieved an accuracy of 98% on the BARTS dataset, which is a high level of performance for a task like a brain tumor segmentation. This highlights the effectiveness of the deep CNN architecture in handling complex medical imaging data and its ability to effectively learn and discriminate between different classes of tumors. However, it is worth noting that the performance of the model may vary when applied to other datasets or when used for practical applications.
